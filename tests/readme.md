# System Tests

This directory contains system tests for the project. System tests are end-to-end tests that test the system (or substantially integrated segments) as a whole. 
They are typically found here when colocating them would either cause dependency cycles or make the tests for a given file overly complex for the simpler unit/functional tests found within the other packages.
